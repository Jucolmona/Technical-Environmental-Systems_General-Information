## Software Installation
In this course, we will use EnergyPlus Sketchup and  OpenStudio which should be downloaded installed from the corresponding links:

* *Important Note*: Pay attention that the softwares should be installed in the same order as given below:

1. EnergyPlus:
In this [Link](https://energyplus.net/downloads) you can download the suitable  version of the software based on your operating System

2. SketchUp:
You can find the suitable installation file (SketchUp Make 2016) for your operating system from this [Link](https://help.sketchup.com/en/downloading-older-versions), Pay attention that we are going to use SketchUp Make and not SketchUp Pro which is a commercial software.

3. OpenStudio:
The installation files of OpenStudio for different operating system can be found [here](https://www.openstudio.net/downloads). 


You can also download  the files from the following [DropBox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7a5iz2t3t9wueli/AADjlkTwG5HMRjnDCvaw-J2Ma?dl=1)



* It is noteworthy that, in case you already have the SketchUp software installed on your computer, you might have to re-install it as the OpenStudio version might not be compatible with your installed version of SketchUp. 

* In order to check whether you have correctly installed the above-mentioned softwares, you should verify that you have the OpenStudio add-on added to your SketchUp tools.

## Project Description 

In the project of the course, geometry of a commercial building should be first introduced in SketchUp and the other characteristics of the building should be then defined employing OpenStudio. The latter software should next be used to calculate the yearly heating and cooling consumption of the building for a base case. Next, a parametric study, should be conducted in order to investigate the effect of changing the position and wall characteristics on the buildingâ€™s yearly energy consumption. Accordingly, the simulation should be performed for three different cities and three different walls, and the corresponding obtained yearly consumptions should be compared with the ones of the base case.

Pay attention that you should conduct the sensitivity analysis on the walls just for one city.
## Project Submission (Deadline Dec. 21st 2018)
Before submitting your projet, you should send us the detailed information about the members of your group by filling out this [form](https://goo.gl/forms/ZWhIzcm5NvjBWDLU2):
